**Lt. Daniels**    
For now, we'll work out of Narcotics,  
with Kima keeping the file.  
We'll copy everything to Ronnie  
at the courthouse and your people.  
  
**Santangelo**  
Fine with us.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**    
McNulty and Santangelo will work  
on the open murders...  
see if anything can be manufactured.  
Kima and my people will do  
hand-to-hand stuff in the Terrace.  
Buy-bust, quick and dirty.  
We put years over top of  
some of these people, we'll roll a few.  
  
**McNulty**  
You're not gonna get  
Avon Barksdale or Stringer Bell...  
or anyone else above the street,  
not on street rips.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**    
You don't know that.  
  
**McNulty**  
These guys are good.  
They're deep and organized.  
They've got everyone running scared.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**    
What do you suggest?  
  
**McNulty**  
Surveillance teams,  
DNRs, asset investigation.  
Keep gathering string  
till we can find a way in.  
Either a wired CI or a Title III.  
That's what makes this case.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**    
Is that what you told the judge?  
  
**McNulty**  
Okay, so I'm an asshole for that.  
But I'm right about this much.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**   
No mics, no wires.  
We do this fast and clean and simple.  
  
**McNulty**  
Then you don't do it at all.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**    
What the fu-  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**    
Seems to me you all could've had this fight  
before calling the State's Attorney's office.  
  
**McNulty**    
Let me ask you something.  
What do we know about Avon Barksdale?  
  
**Greggs**  
What do we know?  
  
**McNulty**  
The guy's owned  
all of Franklin Terrace for a year.  
What do we have on him right now?  
A DOB? A sheet?  
A B of I photo?  
We don't even have  
a fucking photo of the guy.  
  
**Santangelo**  
Gimme a break, Jimmy.  
Two days ago no one on this fucking floor  
knew this mope's name.  
Now he's some kinda criminal mastermind.  
  
**Herc**    
Shit, I say we go down to the Terrace  
and fuck some people up.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**    
You all don't need a prosecutor,  
you need a fucking referee.  
When you know how  
you're playing this, give a yell.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**    
We know how we're playing it.  
My people are going down  
to do some hand-to-hands.  
Detectives McNulty and Santangelo are  
going to the hall to review old murder files...  
and try to manufacture a fresh prosecution.  
As things heat up, I'll go to the deputy  
and get us more manpower...  
but this case is not going to sprawl.  
A month from now,  
we're all gonna be back at our day jobs.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**    
Fine. Bring me your hand-to-hands.  
Anything on the murders, you can take  
to Ilene Nathan in violent crimes.  
I'll clue her in.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**    
Anything else?  
  
**Lt. Daniels**    
One last thing:  
No one does anything at all on the street  
without me knowing about it first.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**   
Chain-of-command, Detective.  
That's how we do things  
down this end of the hall.
